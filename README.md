# Mailboxes: Inbox for items

This mod provides blocky inboxes for items. Mailboxes can be unrent (creating a free mailbox) and rent, and set to be accepting or not accepting non-book items.

This mod is a fork of, and compatible with, [LinuxForks's mailbox mod](https://git.bananach.space/mailbox.git), an extract of the [old `xdecor` mod](https://github.com/minetest-mods/xdecor).
